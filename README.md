<h1>MicroPython Automated Garden</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project utilizing the RaspberryPi Pico microcontroller. The pico controls a series of relays that can be switched pending results received from a temperature and humidity sensor. In addition, the pico uses the system time to regulate watering frequency and duration. The relays are wired to a wall outlet which powers the garden's fans, water pump, uv light, and humidifier. The pico controls a small LCD that displays plant climate data, current readings from the sensor, and system time. This project is my hobby and will update continuously.</p>
